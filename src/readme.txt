This folder contains files created by ASV (http://www.buraks.com/asv) that will help you rebuild a .FLA file for the SWF file "D:\Xampp\htdocs\asv\PRODUCTION-201611291003-338511768.swf". Flash CS6 is required. Please refer to ASV help for more information.

You need to do the following:

1- Make sure Flash is not running.

2- Double-click on the "rebuildcommand.jsfl" script in this folder.

(When importing FLV files, the following options must be selected:
Where is your video file? On your computer, Embed FLV in SWF and play in timeline.
How would you like to embed the video? Symbol type: Embedded video. Place instance on stage option must be unchecked.).

Note: During complex rebuilds, Flash may crash. In such cases following workaround may help. Instead of running "rebuildcommand.jsfl" script, run each JSFL script in the 'jsfl' folder manually (by double-clicking) in this order: 'import.jsfl', 'rebuildpart1.jsfl', 'rebuildpart2.jsfl' ... and so on. Wait for each script to finish before running the next.

3- Review any notes below and fine tune the FLA.

Notes:

Original SWF version is 14.
Local playback security attribute is: Access network only.
Script time limit is: 60 seconds.

10 fonts saved. [If a saved font is not already installed on your system, open the saved font file by double-clicking on it (which will temporarily install the font), then keep the font file open during rebuild.].
